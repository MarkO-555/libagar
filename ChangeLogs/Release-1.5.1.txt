Release Notes for Agar 1.5.1 (Organic Hallucination)
----------------------------------------------------

Here are some of the most notable changes since Agar 1.5.0, in no
particular order.

This release preserves backward compatibility with Agar 1.4.x, but it is
recommended to compile Agar with the `--disable-legacy' configure option,
ensuring that existing applications are not using deprecated calls.

- WEB: Introduce Agar HTTP/1.1 application server interface. Agar-WEB provides
  a modular, multiprocess, privilege-separated environment for implementing
  high-performance web applications. Agar-WEB handles authentication & session
  management, input parsing and validation (URL/FORMDATA/JSON/Binary BLOBs),
  Push events and built-in Zlib compression. Agar-WEB also provides a HTML
  template engine (variable substitution) with multilanguage capabilities.
