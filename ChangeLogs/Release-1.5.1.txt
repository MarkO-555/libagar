Release Notes for Agar 1.5.1 (Organic Hallucination)
----------------------------------------------------

Here are some of the most notable changes since Agar 1.5.0, in no
particular order.

This release preserves backward compatibility with Agar 1.4.x, but it is
recommended to compile Agar with the `--disable-legacy' configure option,
ensuring that existing applications are not using deprecated calls.

- Fix some compiler warnings. Set _DEFAULT_SOURCE to accommodate glibc whims.
- Fix build issue and warnings under Cygwin host.
- Fix missing include for 32-bit MSYS build. Thanks varialus!
- CORE: Introduce AG_{Copy,Write,Skip}StringPadded() for fixed-length records.
- CORE: Introduce AG_DelTimers().
- CORE: Introduce AG_Web(3), the Agar HTTP/1.1 application server. This tiny
  library can be used to create multiprocess, privilege-separated application
  servers. It handles authentication, sessions, compression and push events.
  It provides a template engine, input parsing and validation routines for URL,
  FORMDATA, JSON and binary BLOB data.
- CORE: Add AG_SetErrorS() variant; avoid printf use by AG_FatalError().
- CORE: Remove unnecessary locks in AG_WriteString().
- CORE: AG_ReadStringLenv() now returns encoded length.
- CORE: Prevent redundant AG_InitCore() or AG_Destroy() calls.
- CORE: Document AG_Db(3) API.
- VG: Fix invalid access under GUI-less operation.
- VG: Fix invalid access in VG_View(3).
- Manual page improvements (clarity, wording, added more examples).
